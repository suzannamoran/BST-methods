# BST-methods
Implementation of a binary search tree with various methods. 

This was an assignment in my Data Structures class that covered implementation of a binary search tree. I was asked to create the methods insert, remove, printPreOrderTraversal, printPostOrderTraversal, and printBreadthFirstTraversal in the NonEmptyBST.java file.

The additional structural code was provided in the assignment materials.
